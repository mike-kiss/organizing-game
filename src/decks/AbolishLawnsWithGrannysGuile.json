    "flavor": "In a quiet town nowhere particularly important lived a sweet old woman. She drank tea and knitted beautiful sweaters for her ungrateful grandchildren. She was co-President of the local Rotory Club and met with her friends on Sunday to play Bridge and exchange the latest gossip. She loved bees and she loved wildflowers and she wished the world were covered with them. One day, she decided to stop wishing and make it happenâ€¦ by any means necessary.",
    "description": "The Knitting Circles of Sumwarre have had enough of the loud lawnmowers and the toxic pesticides. They are going to Abolish Lawns and they are not afraid to get their hands dirty to do it. Use your Green Thumb to make 10,000 flowers bloom while you use Dirty Tricks to win the Mayor's Office and take over City Council. Grow from a Shady Grandma into a Social Club President or from a Wise Old Woman into a Foundation Founder. Just do what you need to do to get the job done.",
